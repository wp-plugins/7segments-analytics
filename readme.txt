== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is 7SEGMENTS ? =
7SEGMENTS Big Data Analytics solution. Provides various analyses, marketing campaigns management (email, sms) and data-mining.

= What user information does it record automatically? =
We automatically identify users that are logged in to your WordPress site, and record their `name`, `email`, `username`, and `website`, so you don't need to write any special code to handle that yourself. It also identifies commenters if it can.

= Which actions does it record automatically? =
We automatically record the different types of WordPress pages your users can visit. All in "Visited" event with various properties (post_type, category, author, title, etc.)

= Can I turn off the automatic event tracking? =
Yup! You can also turn off specific events, in case you only want a few.

= Can I ignore logged-in users? =
Yup! You can even _just_ ignore Administrators or Editors too.

= I'm a developer, what should I know? =

So very much.  The two biggest enhancements for developers are the introduction of the `segment_get_current_user_identify` and `segment_get_current_page_track` filters.  As a developer, you can hook into these filters and add any sort of conditional logic you want to track any event on a page, or customize the user identification system to hook into your own user system as needed.  Super extensible!

Beyond that, we've completely refactored the plugin to use all of the appropriate WordPress APIs (Like the Settings API) and have added a easily extendable abstract class for eCommerce platforms.  On top of all of that, all of our filters, classes, functions and methods are fully documented inline.

Need to add custom settings?  By hooking into our `segment_default_settings` and `segment_settings_core_validation` filters, you can quickly and easily add your own settings to the Segment plugin.
